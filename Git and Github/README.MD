### What is git and Github? what's difference between them
github: it is just a platform like google drive which is used to store your data, nothing than this.
but enrich with optios like collaboration, pull, push etc.

git: it is a VCS or agent who tracks everything you do on your local machine or directory? everything will be saved on your local machine, will not go on cloud untill you'll push it.

-- CMD Lines
1. git init - says to git that I want to track this directory or file.

**  ls -a (to show hidden files) linux cmd line
**  cat filename.ext (read the content of the provided file)
** echo "data you want to write" > filename.ext (> single will overrite if file exists otherwise new will be created)
** echo "data you want to write" >> filename.ext (>> append)

2. git add filename or git add .(for all) - git will not know which file you want to track which not, so it asks using git cmd line: git add filename (before this you'll see msg untracked on any file or dir)

3.
